## Project Description

### Activities
  
- Collected Housing data for various cities in a CSV file, performed data cleaning, 
Feature Engineering, Outlier Removal by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Created models for various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like Linear Regression, 
Lasso Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.
- Trained the model with the input dataset.
- Identified Linear Regression as the best model after performing hyper parameter 
tuning with the help of Scikit-Learn GridSearchCV.
- Created and loaded the Pickle file as the model, added UI, where we can predict the
house price in various cities in the Washington State.
- Used Nginx as web and reverse proxy server.
- Created Docker containers using Docker compose.
- Created GitHub workflow to perform CI/CD and deployed in Heroku.
